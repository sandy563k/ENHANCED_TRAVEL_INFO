# ENHANCED_TRAVEL_INFO
The objective of the project is to design and implement a complete
service-based distributed web application that provides users enhanced information about a travel route.

This project is implemented using the MONGODB, NODEJS, EXPRESS software stack, which is free, open source Java script software stack useful to build dynamic websites and web applications. The details of choice of technologies are as follows.
• Node.js API IS used for server-side application development
• NPM package Express.js is used for server
• Mongo Db IS used for database application development
• JS & HTML is used for client-side implementation
• Mongoose is used for Object data modelling
• The application user interface homepage consists of a
page to input source, destination.
• Java Script Maps API and Weather API will be used to fetch
the routes and weather information on the fly
The relevant route and weather info of selected cities in the route will be displayed as output on request submit
Repeated requests are cached and are served directly without the need to fetch from third-party APIs
